   abstract = {<p>In cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, fungal colonization of the respiratory tract is frequently found. Aspergillus fumigatus is the most frequently recorded and is associated with loss of pulmonary function and allergic disease (ABPA). The knowledge on prevalence rates of filamentous fungi in CF patients in Latin America is scarce. One hundred and seventy-six fungal isolates recovered from the upper respiratory tract of CF patients from Argentina were identified to species by morphology and DNA sequencing. In total, 90\% of CF patients were colonized by Aspergillus sp., followed by Exophiala sp. (14\%) and Scedosporium sp. (10\%). Among Aspergillus, six species complexes (Fumigati, Flavi, Terrei, Nigri, Usti, and Nidulante) and different cryptospecies were found. Among Scedosporium, three species were observed (Scedosporium apiospermum, Scedosporium aurantiacum and Scedosporium boydii). All Exophiala isolates were identified as Exophiala dermatitidis. Rare filamentous fungi were also found. All cases of ABPA were associated to the presence of A. fumigatus. Mixed colonization with other mould or rare fungi was observed in half of them. To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study of mould species in CF using molecular methods in Latin America. This study shows that Aspergillus sp., E. dermatitidis and Scedosporium sp. have a high frequency in CF patients from Argentina, and by far, A. fumigatus was the most commonly cultured species. Continuous clinical surveillance is required to detect the emergence of new fungal pathogens and to detect resistant or difficult-to-treat species capable of chronic colonizing the airways and of hematogenous dissemination in case of lung transplantation.</p>},

   abstract = {<p> The treatment of invasive and chronic aspergillosis involves triazole drugs. Its intensive use has resulted in the selection of resistant isolates, and at present, azole resistance in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Aspergillus fumigatus</named-content> is considered an emerging threat to public health worldwide. The aim of this work is to uncover the molecular mechanism implicated in the azole resistance phenotype of three <named-content content-type="genus-species">Aspergillus fumigatus</named-content> clinical strains isolated from an Argentinian cystic fibrosis patient under long-term triazole treatment. Strain susceptibilities were assessed, and <italic>CYP51A</italic> gene sequences were analyzed. Two of the studied <named-content content-type="genus-species">Aspergillus fumigatus</named-content> strains harbored the TR34-L98H allele. These strains showed high MIC values for all tested triazoles (&gt;16.00 μg/ml, 1.00 μg/ml, 1.00 μg/ml, and 2.00 μg/ml for itraconazole, isavuconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole, respectively). The third strain had a novel amino acid change (R65K) combined with the TR34-L98H mutations. This new mutation combination induces a pan-azole MIC augment compared with TR34-L98H mutants (&gt;16 μg/ml, 4.00 μg/ml, 4.00 μg/ml, and 8.00 μg/ml for itraconazole, isavuconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole, respectively). The strain harboring the TR34-R65K-L98H allele showed no inhibition halo when voriconazole susceptibility was evaluated by disk diffusion. The effect of these mutations in the azole-resistant phenotype was confirmed by gene replacement experiments. Transformants harboring the TR34-L98H and TR34-R65K-L98H alleles mimicked the azole-resistant phenotype of the clinical isolates, while the incorporation of the TR34-R65K and R65K alleles did not significantly increase azole MIC values. This is the first report of the TR34-L98H allele in Argentina. Moreover, a novel <italic>CYP51A</italic> allele (TR34-R65K-L98H) that induces a pan-azole MIC augment is described. </p>},

   abstract = {Nanotechnology has recently emerged as a promising tool in biomedicine research. An important branch of nanotechnology is drug delivery (DD) and drug targeting using a wide range of biomaterials with promising potential applications in many diseases. The aim of this chapter is to provide an overview of the evolution of nanotechnology in controlled pulmonary DD, exemplified by the myriad of applications in cancer, infectious diseases, asthma, and chronic pulmonary disease. Particular attention will be focused on the formulation strategies for improving systemic bioavailability of inhaled drugs and macromolecules, the formulation strategies for improving local targeting in the lung (airways versus alveoli), the formulation strategies for delivering drug and macromolecules, including siRNA and DNA into cells, and the formulation strategies with improved dose consistency. Recent nanoformulations and the biomaterials that are under investigation for controlled pulmonary DD, including preclinical and clinical studies, are included in this chapter.},

   abstract = {Voriconazole (VCZ) is a triazolic drug used to treat serious fungal infections and invasive mycosis and hasalso been more recently used as a generic antifungal treatment. However, VCZ therapies can causeundesirable side effects and doses must be carefully monitored before administration to avoid or reducesevere toxic effects. Analytical techniques used to quantify VCZ are mostly based on HPLC/UV and oftenassociated with multiple technical steps as well as expensive equipment. The present work aimed todevelop an accessible and affordable spectrophotometric technique in the visible range (l=514 nm) forthe simple quantification of VCZ. The technique was based on VCZ-induced reduction of thionine (TH,red) to leucothionine (LTH, colorless) under alkaline conditions. The reaction showed a linear correlationover the range of 1.00mgmL−1to 60.00mgmL−1at room temperature, the limits of detection andquantification being 1.93mgmL−1and 6.45mgmL−1, respectively. VCZ degradation products (DPs)according to1H and13C-NMR spectrometric determinations not only showed good agreement with theones previously reported (DP1 and DP2–T. M. Barbosa, G. A. Morris, M. Nilsson, R. Rittner and C. F.Tormena,RSCAdv., 2017, DOI:10.1039/c7ra03822d), but also revealed a new degradation product(DP3). Mass spectrometry not only confirmed the presence of LTH as a result of the VCZ DP-induced THreduction, but also revealed the formation of a novel and stable Schiffbase as a reaction productbetween DP1 and LTH. The latterfinding became significant as it stabilizes the reaction for quantificationpurposes,  by  hindering  LTH4TH  redox  reversibility.  This  analytical  method  was  then  validatedaccording to the ICH Q2 (R1) guidelines, and additionally, it could be demonstrated as applicable for thereliable VCZ quantification in commercially available tablets. Importantly, it also represents a useful toolfor detecting toxic threshold concentrations in human plasma from VCZ-treated patients, alerting whenthese risky limits are exceeded. In this way, this technique independent from sophisticated equipment,highly qualifies as a low-cost, reproducible, trustable, and non-laborious alternative method for VCZmeasurements from different matrices.},

   abstract = {Sporotrichosis is considered a neglected disease of humans and animals in many regions of the world and is the most frequent implantation mycosis in Latin America. Objectives: To illustrate the zoonotic importance of the disease, describing a case involving a veterinarian and an infant that acquired the disease from a domestic cat and to describe, genotype and characterize these new isolates. Methods: Direct examination of tissue samples from the two patients and feline lesions revealed the presence of Sporothrix yeast-like organisms. Fungal cultures and molecular identification of the strains were performed. Since antifungal susceptibility data of animal-borne isolates are scarce, the in vitro susceptibility testing by a microdilution reference method was determined against azoles, amphotericin B and terbinafine. Results: Fungal culture and sequence analysis of the ITS region of rDNA and calmodulin and β-tubulin genes confirmed the diagnosis and the causative agent as Sporothrix brasiliensis. In all cases, terbinafine was the most active drug, followed by posaconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole; the least active drugs were amphotericine B and fluconazole. Lack of clinical response in the veterinarian and in the infant to itraconazole and potassium iodide, respectively was observed. Conclusions: This study contributed to the molecular epidemiology of Sporothrix species in Argentina and the characterization of the in vitro susceptibility pattern of S. brasiliensis isolates recovered from a cat and two humans involved in this case of zoonotic sporotrichosis. Bearing in mind the “One Health” concept, the experience described in the present study highlights the need for future strategies for sporotrichosis treatment, control and prevention.},
